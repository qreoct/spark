# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Create an .env file with your [Unsplash API Access Key](https://unsplash.com/developers).
**Note**: Do **NOT** publish your API key in any React build; it will be accessible publicly. Use a backend instead.
